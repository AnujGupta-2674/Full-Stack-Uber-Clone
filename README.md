## About the Project

The **Full-Stack Uber Clone** is a comprehensive project that replicates the core functionality of a ride-hailing application like Uber. It is designed to provide users and captains (drivers) with a seamless experience, from registering and logging in to booking and managing rides. This project is an excellent demonstration of a full-stack developer's capabilities, showcasing skills in building a scalable backend, integrating frontend with real-time data, and leveraging APIs for geolocation and mapping.

### Features
The application includes two primary user roles: **Users** and **Captains**. Users can register, login, and book rides by selecting a pickup and destination address. The fare estimate feature provides an upfront cost for the ride based on the chosen vehicle type (auto, car, or motorcycle). Captains can register with details about their vehicle, log in to manage their profiles, and accept rides. Both users and captains have secure authentication using JWT tokens, ensuring data privacy and security.

The application integrates Google Maps APIs for real-time geolocation, address suggestions, and route mapping. This integration allows users to track their rides and receive accurate distance and time estimates. Furthermore, the backend is built to handle API calls efficiently, ensuring fast response times and smooth operations for ride creation, fare calculation, and profile management.

### Technologies Used
The **Full-Stack Uber Clone** leverages a modern technology stack, including React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. The frontend provides an interactive and responsive UI, while the backend ensures robust functionality with secure user authentication and efficient data handling. The project also uses Google Maps services extensively for geolocation, distance calculation, and map visualization.

This project highlights real-world problem-solving by simulating a high-demand application, focusing on performance, scalability, and usability. It's not just a clone but a platform for learning and extending features such as dynamic pricing, ride-sharing, and payment gateway integration, making it a solid foundation for a real-world application.
